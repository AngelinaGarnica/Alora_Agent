# Alora Agent

Alora is an intelligent agent designed to assist with data analysis.

This notebook demonstrates how to build a LangChain agent using Gemini to interact with a SQL database, generate queries and optionally suggest plotting results. It was created as the final project for the **5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course**.
